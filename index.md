# What is it?

ImageProcessor is a collection of lightweight libraries written in C# that
allows you to manipulate images on-the-fly using .NET 4.5+

It consists of two main libraries **ImageProcessor** - For desktop and application use
and **ImageProcessor.Web** - a dynamic image processing extension built for ASP.NET.

It's lighting fast, extensible, easy to use, comes bundled with some great features and is fully open source.

# Buy me a beer?

**ImageProcessor** is free and open source but developing it has taken thousands of hours of my time and a
large part of my sanity. If you feel like dropping me a few precious pounds (there's no obligation) it would go a great way to ensuring that I can
afford to take the time to continue to improve the library.
