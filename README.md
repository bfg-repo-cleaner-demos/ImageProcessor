# ImageProcessor

**This branch contains the highly experimental cross platform version of ImageProcessor**.

This is a complete rewrite from the ground up to allow the processing of images without the use of `System.Drawing` using a portable class library (PCL).

###Why am I writing this?

With NETCore there is currently no version of `System.Drawing` to allow continued progress of the existing ImageProcessor library. Progress developing a crossplatform update are restricted to the [CoreFXLab repo](https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab/tree/master/src/System.Drawing.Graphics) where progress seems to be very slow.

###Is this wise?

Honestly... I don't know. I could be writing code that may be suddenly obsolete. There has been little [feedback](https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab/issues/86#issuecomment-139930600) on questions I've asked but it's a nice learning process if anything.

###What works so far/ What is planned?

- Encoding/decoding of image formats (plugable)
 - [x] jpeg (Includes progressive)
 - [x] bmp (More bmp format saving support required, 24bit just now)
 - [x] png (Need updating for saving indexed support)
 - [x] gif
- Basic color structs with implicit operators. Vector backed.
 - [x] Color - Float based, No limit to r, g, b, a values allowing for a fuller color range.

###What might never happen
- Font support (Depends on new System.Text stuff)

###How can you help?

Spread the word, contribute algorithms, performance improvements, unit tests. Help me setup the solution properly for NETCore etc (I dunno if I have my setup correct) 

There's a lot of developers out there who could write this stuff a lot better and faster than I and I would love to see what people can come up with.
