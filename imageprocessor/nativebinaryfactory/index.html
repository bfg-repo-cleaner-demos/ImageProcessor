    <h1>NativeBinaryFactory</h1>
    <p>
        The NativeBinaryFactory class controls the loading and unloading of any native (unmanaged) binaries required by ImageProcessor.
        This ensures that any C++ binaries referenced or embedded within plugins can be loaded into memory and utilized by ImageProcessor.
    </p>
    <p>
        An instance of NativeBinaryFactory is lazily initialized via the ImageProcessorBootstrapper singleton class
        and exposes a single <a href="registernativebinary/">method</a> to use.
