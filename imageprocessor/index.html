    <h1>ImageProcessor</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>ImageProcessor</strong> is a lightweight library designed to make manipulation of images easier using .NET 4.5+.
    </p>
    <p>
        It contains multiple methods within the core functionality that allows for image manipulation via the
        <a href="imagefactory/">ImageFactory</a> class. This has a fluent API which allows you to easily chain methods to deliver the desired output.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>ImageProcessor</strong> contains no web specific components so is suitable for both desktop and web applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        The base library supports processing of jpg, jpeg, png, png8, gif (both animated and static), bmp, and tiff file formats.

    <h1>Extending ImageProcessor</h1>
    <p>
        ImageProcessor is built with extensibility in mind. All the individual processors used within the ImageFactory methods
        follow an interface <code>IGraphicsprocessor</code> while file format support can be extended using the <code>ISupportedImageFormat</code>
        interface. This allows developers' to extend the library to suit their needs.
    </p>

    <p>Details of those interfaces can be found in the <a href="extending/">extending</a> documentation.</p>
