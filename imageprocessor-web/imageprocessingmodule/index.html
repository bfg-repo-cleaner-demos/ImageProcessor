    <h1>ImageProcessingModule</h1>
    <p>
        The ImageProcessingModule class provides methods to perform various manipulation functions on a given image based on querystring parameters.
        The HttpModule is asynchronous and optimized for performance so that your website does not slow down under heavy load.

            The API for ImageProcessor.Web is imperative. This means that the order in which you supply the querystring parameters is the order in which the
            individual processors are implemented. This allows the API to be very flexible, allowing you to combine processes in any order.

    <h1>Caching</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>ImageProcessor.Web</strong> comes with caching as standard. Any processed image are asynchronously cached both in the browser and on the server
        for a length of your choosing. The server cache intelligently stores millions of images and silently updates itself should the original image change or
        the cache expire.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cached files are stored in nested folders based on an SHA1 representation of the full url with a small number of images in each folder.
        This allows for the storage of millions of images whilst ensuring that the OS does not suffer from any slowdown due to file indexing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The caching mechanism saves massive amounts of processing power and bandwidth that help to keep your website snappy.
