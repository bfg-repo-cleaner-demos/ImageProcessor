<section id="about">
    <h1>ImageProcessor.Web</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>ImageProcessor.Web</strong> is a web extension to ImageProcessor that allows the developer to perform image
        manipulation using a Url API of querystring parameters as instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
        This works by adding a configurable HttpModule to your website which intercepts local and remote image requests,
        processing them on-the-fly to your desired output.
    </p>
    <div class="alert">
     <h4>Important</h4>
        <p>
            As of <strong>ImageProcessor.Web v4.3.0</strong> Support for for the legacy url API has been dropped. This was done 
            in order to allow the fixing of longstanding bugs.
        </p>

    <h1>Setting Up Your Configuration</h1>
    <p>
        When installing ImageProcessor.Web, by default, you will find that the <code>web.config</code> will have been altered.
        This allows the libraries ImageProcessingModule to intercept local image processing requests.
    </p>
    <p>
        ImageProcessor.Web is highly configurable. Additional configuration files can be added to the solution which
        allow for retrieval, processing and caching of images from multiple sources.
    </p>

    <p>Details of those configuration files can be found in the <a href="configuration/">configuration</a> documentation.</p>

    <div class="alert">
        <p>
            As of <strong>ImageProcessor.Web v3.2.0</strong> configuration outwith the <code>Web.Config</code> file is not installed automatically.
            Instead default configuration matching the values below is built into the system. To overwrite these settings install the nuget package:
            <code>Install-Package ImageProcessor.Web.Config</code>
        </p>

    <h1>Extending ImageProcessor.Web</h1>
    <p>
        ImageProcessor.Web is built with extensibility in mind. You can use various provided interfaces in conjunction with the configuration
        to extend almost every aspect of the library from plugins to caching giving you complete control over your setup.
    </p>

    <p>Details of those interfaces can be found in the <a href="extending/">extending</a> documentation.</p>
